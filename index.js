                        <p className='text-start'>I recently completed a passion project where I built a Tic Tac Toe game using React, which allowed me to enhance my skills as a developer. 
                        The classic two-player game features a 3x3 board where players take turns marking X's or O's until one player gets three in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
                        My Tic Tac Toe game features a responsive design, which means it works seamlessly on any device, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
                        The game also includes an interactive scoreboard that tracks the number of wins, losses, and draws for each player, making it more engaging for players.
                        Overall, my Tic Tac Toe game showcases my skills as a React developer and offers an interactive and fun way for players to challenge their friends and family.</p>

                        <p className='text-start'>This project focuses on the design, implementation and testing of a Python program which
                        uses a module to play a card game, Klondike Solitaire. The game is played by one person
                        with a standard 52-card deck of playing cards. The goal of the game is to build four foundations
                        (one for each of the four suits), where all of the cards in each foundation are in order from Ace to
                        King (with the Ace on the bottom). The following website has an on-line version of Klondike (Turn One) and a short video
                        introduction to the game: <a href="https://worldofsolitaire.com/" target="_blank">http://worldofsolitaire.com/</a>. Note that the game rules used for this project are simpler than the rules discussed on the website.
                        Notably, the online game allows a multi-card pile to be moved between columns of the tableauâ€”
                        this project only allows one card at a time to be moved.</p>

                        <p className='text-start'>The markdown previewer project is a web application that I built using React and Bootstrap that allows users to input markdown text and see it rendered in real-time.
                        These are self-taught skills that I learned as a result of working through various courses on Freecodecamp.com.
                        It has robust markdown parsing capabilities, including handling complex markdown syntax, such as headings, lists, tables, and code blocks. The interface is designed with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind, and the layout is fully responsive for optimal viewing on any device.
                        The project demonstrates how React and Bootstrap can be used together to create a high-quality, 
                        feature-rich web application that is an excellent tool for quickly and easily converting markdown to HTML.</p>

                        <p className='text-start'>This passion project encompasses my passion for sports and programming, as I created an NBA game predictor model using Python. The project is a work in progress that involves the use of several powerful Python libraries, including Beautifulsoup and Scikit-learn.
                        To build the NBA game predictor, I used Beautifulsoup to scrape data from various websites, such as Basketball Reference. This data was then processed and analyzed using Python and the Pandas library. The data was split using the sklearn library, which allowed me to train the model and make predictions.
                        One of the key challenges in building an NBA game predictor model is the large amount of data involved. However, with the help of Python and its libraries, I was able to efficiently process and analyze the data to make accurate predictions.
                        Overall, the NBA game predictor project is an exciting application of Python for sports enthusiasts and data scientists alike. 
                        While it is still a work in progress, the project demonstrates the power and flexibility of Python for data analysis and machine learning.</p>

                        <p className='text-center'>This project focuses on the design, implementation and testing of a Python program which
                        uses a module to play a card game, Klondike Solitaire. Klondike is one of the most popular solitaire card games. The game is played by one person
                        with a standard 52-card deck of playing cards. The goal of the game is to build four foundations
                        (one for each of the four suits), where all of the cards in each foundation are in order from Ace to
                        King (with the Ace on the bottom). The following website has an on-line version of Klondike (Turn One) and a short video
                        introduction to the game: <a href="https://worldofsolitaire.com/" target="_blank">http://worldofsolitaire.com/</a>. Note that the game rules used for this project are simpler than the rules discussed on the website.
                        Notably, the online game allows a multi-card pile to be moved between columns of the tableauâ€”
                        this project only allows one card at a time to be moved.</p>

                        <p className='text-center'>The markdown previewer project is a web application that I built using React and Bootstrap that allows users to input markdown text and see it rendered in real-time.
                        These are self-taught skills that I learned as a result of working through various courses on Freecodecamp.com.
                        It has robust markdown parsing capabilities, including handling complex markdown syntax, such as headings, lists, tables, and code blocks. The interface is designed with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind, and the layout is fully responsive for optimal viewing on any device.
                        The project demonstrates how React and Bootstrap can be used together to create a high-quality, 
                        feature-rich web application that is an excellent tool for quickly and easily converting markdown to HTML.</p>

                        <p className='text-center'>This passion project encompasses my passion for sports and programming, as I created an NBA game predictor model using Python. The project is a work in progress that involves the use of several powerful Python libraries, including Beautifulsoup and Scikit-learn.
                        To build the NBA game predictor, I used Beautifulsoup to scrape data from various websites, such as Basketball Reference. This data was then processed and analyzed using Python and the Pandas library. The data was split using the sklearn library, which allowed me to train the model and make predictions.
                        One of the key challenges in building an NBA game predictor model is the large amount of data involved. However, with the help of Python and its libraries, I was able to efficiently process and analyze the data to make accurate predictions.
                        Overall, the NBA game predictor project is an exciting application of Python for sports enthusiasts and data scientists alike. 
                        While it is still a work in progress, the project demonstrates the power and flexibility of Python for data analysis and machine learning.</p>
